Use foreach loops where appropriate

cut layout
	panel(chine1, chine2)
		Trianglize
		Handle pointy end

	panels(hull)
		high resolution chines
		loop
			panel()

    DOABLE? This should also remove SetHull?

EXCEPTIONS:
    LoadFromHullFile instead of returning a string

Dynamically update views while moving handle.
Handle transom correctly.

Spline bulkhead for bow/stern

Compute planes for transom bulkheads

Add/position bulkheads
Splines.GetAt(coord)



MVC: Model (data) View (appearance) Control (user interaction): should be separate classes.
