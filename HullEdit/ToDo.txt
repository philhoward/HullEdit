Code/Implementation Enhancements
	Does Bulkhead need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged?
	Use foreach loops where appropriate
		Started, need to finish.
	MVC: Model (data) View (appearance) Control (user interaction): should be separate classes.

	EXCEPTIONS:
		Throw appropriate ones, and handle all of them.

	WPF can do rotations. Do I need to do them manually?
	WPF can do scaling, but it seems to scale pen widths. Can I use WPF scaling without managing pen widths?

Bugs
	going to a small window size sometimes obscures the perspective view (appears to be drawn off-screen).
